       " 'text': '4: Fidelity on the Left 990  Although the policy arguments for extending marriage to same-sex couples may be compelling,  the legal arguments for requiring such an extension are not. The fundamental right to marry  does not include a right to make a State change its definition of marriage. And a State\\'s  decision to maintain the meaning of marriage that has persisted in every culture throughout  human history can hardly be called irrational. In short, our Constitution does not enact any  one theory of marriage. The people of a State are free to expand marriage to include same-sex  couples, or to retain the historic definition.  Today, however, the Court takes the extraordinary step of ordering every State to license and  recognize same-sex marriage. Many people will rejoice at this decision, and I begrudge none  their celebration. But for those who believe in a government of laws, not of men, the majority\\'s  approach is deeply disheartening. Supporters of same-sex marriage have achieved considerable  success persuading their fellow citizens—through the democratic process—to adopt their view.  That *2612ends today. Five lawyers have closed the debate and enacted their own vision of  marriage as a matter of constitutional law. Stealing this issue from the people will for many cast  a cloud over same-sex marriage, making a dramatic social change that much more difficult to  accept.  The majority\\'s decision is an act of will, not legal judgment. The right it announces has no  basis in the Constitution or this Court\\'s precedent. The majority expressly disclaims judicial  \"caution\" and omits even a pretense of humility, openly relying on its desire to remake society  according to its own \"new insight\" into the \"nature of injustice.\" Ante, at 11, 23. As a result, the  Court invalidates the marriage laws of more than half the States and orders the transformation  of a social institution that has formed the basis of human society for millennia, for the Kalahari  Bushmen and the Han Chinese, the Carthaginians and the Aztecs. Just who do we think we  are?  It can be tempting for judges to confuse our own preferences with the requirements of the law.  But as this Court has been reminded throughout our history, the Constitution \"is made for  people of fundamentally differing views.\" Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45, 76 (1905)  (Holmes, J., dissenting). Accordingly, \"courts are not concerned with the wisdom or policy of  legislation.\" Id.,at 69 (Harlan, J., dissenting). The majority today neglects that restrained  conception of the judicial role. It seizes for itself a question the Constitution leaves to the  people, at a time when the people are engaged in a vibrant debate on that question. And it  answers that question based not on neutral principles of constitutional law, but on its own  \"understanding of what freedom is and must become.\" Ante, at 19. I have no choice but to  dissent.  Understand well what this dissent is about: It is not about whether, in my judgment, the  institution of marriage should be changed to include same-sex couples. It is instead about  whether, in our democratic republic, that decision should rest with the people acting through  their elected representatives, or with five lawyers who happen to hold commissions authorizing  them to resolve legal disputes according to law. The Constitution leaves no doubt about the  answer.  I  Petitioners and their amici base their arguments on the \"right to marry\" and the imperative of  \"marriage equality.\" There is no serious dispute that, under our precedents, the Constitution  protects a right to marry and requires States to apply their marriage laws equally. The real  question in these cases is what constitutes \"marriage,\" or—more precisely—who decides what  constitutes \"marriage\"?  The majority largely ignores these questions, relegating ages of human experience with  marriage to a paragraph or two. Even if history and precedent are not \"the end\" of these  cases, ante, at 4, I would not \"sweep away what has so long been settled\" without showing  greater respect for all that preceded us.'}"

As we have noted, while his opinion in Heller recommended an  interest-balancing test, the Court specifically rejected that suggestion. See supra, at 3046-3047.  \"The very enumeration of the right takes out of the hands of government—even the Third  Branch of Government—the power to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the right is really  worth insisting upon.\" Heller, supra, at ___, 128 S.Ct., at 2821.  * * *  In Heller, we held that the Second Amendment protects the right to possess a handgun in the  home for the purpose of self-defense. Unless considerations of stare decisis counsel otherwise,  a provision of the Bill of Rights that protects a right that is fundamental from an American  perspective applies equally to the Federal Government and the States. See Duncan, 391 U.S.,  at 149, and n. 14, 88 S.Ct. 1444. We therefore hold that the Due Process Clause of the  Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Second Amendment right recognized in Heller. The  judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further  proceedings.  It is so ordered.  See Brief for Heartland Institute as Amicus Curiae 6-7 (noting that handgun murder rate was  9.65 in 1983 and 13.88 in 2008).  2  Brief for Buckeye Firearms Foundation, Inc., et al. as Amici Curiae 8-9 (\"In 2002 and again in  2008, Chicago had more murders than any other city in the U.S., including the much larger  Los Angeles and New York\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also Brief for  International Law Enforcement Educators and Trainers Association et al. as Amici Curiae 17- 21, and App. A (providing comparisons of Chicago\\'s rates of assault, murder, and robbery to  average crime rates in 24 other large cities).  3  Brief for Women State Legislators et al. as Amici Curiae 2.  4  The Illinois State Rifle Association and the Second Amendment Foundation, Inc.  5  The first sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment makes \"[a]ll persons born or naturalized in  the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof . . . citizens of the United States and of  the State wherein they reside.\" (Emphasis added.)

       "  'text': '4: Fidelity on the Left 762  Our decision in Heller points unmistakably to the answer. Self-defense is a basic right,  recognized by many legal systems from ancient times to the present day,15 and in Heller, we  held that individual self-defense is \"the central component\" of the Second Amendment right.  554 U.S., at ___, 128 S.Ct., at 2801-2802; see also id., at ___, 128 S.Ct., at 2817 (stating that  the \"inherent right of self-defense has been central to the Second Amendment right\").  Explaining that \"the need for defense of self, family, and property is most acute\" in the home,  ibid., we found that this right applies to handguns because they are \"the most preferred firearm  in the nation to `keep\\' and use for protection of one\\'s home and family,\" id., at ___, 128 S.Ct.,  at 2818 (some internal quotation marks omitted); see also id., at ___, 128 S.Ct., at 2817  (noting that handguns are \"overwhelmingly chosen by American society for [the] lawful  purpose\" of self-defense); id., at ___, 128 S.Ct., at 2818 (\"[T]he American people have  considered the handgun to be the quintessential self-defense weapon\"). Thus, we concluded,  citizens must be permitted \"to use [handguns] for the core lawful purpose of self-defense.\" Id.,  at ___, 128 S.Ct., at 2818.  Heller makes it clear that this right is \"deeply rooted in this Nation\\'s history and tradition.\"  Glucksberg, supra, at 721, 117 S.Ct. 2302 (internal quotation marks omitted). Heller explored  the right\\'s origins, noting that the 1689 English Bill of Rights explicitly protected a right to  keep arms for self-defense, 554 U.S., at ___ - ___, 128 S.Ct., at 2797-2798, and that by 1765,  Blackstone was able to assert that the right to keep and bear arms was \"one of the fundamental  rights of Englishmen,\" id., at ___, 128 S.Ct., at 2798.  *3037 Blackstone\\'s assessment was shared by the American colonists. As we noted in Heller,  King George III\\'s attempt to disarm the colonists in the 1760\\'s and 1770\\'s \"provoked polemical  reactions by Americans invoking their rights as Englishmen to keep arms.\"16 Id., at ___, 128  S.Ct., at 2799; see also L. Levy, Origins of the Bill of Rights 137-143 (1999) (hereinafter Levy).  The right to keep and bear arms was considered no less fundamental by those who drafted and  ratified the Bill of Rights. \"During the 1788 ratification debates, the fear that the federal  government would disarm the people in order to impose rule through a standing army or  select militia was pervasive in Antifederalist rhetoric.\" Heller, supra, at ___, 128 S.Ct., at 2801  (citing Letters from the Federal Farmer III (Oct. 10, 1787), in 2 The Complete Anti-Federalist  234, 242 (H. Storing ed.1981)); see also Federal Farmer: An Additional Number of Letters to  the Republican, Letter XVIII (Jan. 25, 1788), in 17 Documentary History of the Ratification of  the Constitution 360, 362-363 (J. Kaminski & G. Saladino eds.1995); S. Halbrook, The  Founders\\' Second Amendment 171-278 (2008). Federalists responded, not by arguing that the  right was insufficiently important to warrant protection but by contending that the right was  adequately protected by the Constitution\\'s assignment of only limited powers to the Federal  Government. Heller, supra, at ___, 128 S.Ct., at 2801-2802; cf. The Federalist No. 46, p. 296  (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison). Thus, Antifederalists and Federalists alike agreed that the  right to bear arms was fundamental to the newly formed system of government. See Levy 143- 149; J. Malcolm, To Keep and Bear Arms: The Origins of an Anglo-American Right 155-164  (1994). But those who were fearful that the new Federal Government would infringe traditional  rights such as the right to keep and bear arms insisted on the adoption of the Bill of Rights as a  condition for ratification of the Constitution. See 1 J. Elliot, The Debates in the Several State  Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution 327-331 (2d ed. 1854); 3 id., at 657- 661; 4 id., at 242-246, 248-249; see also Levy 26-34; A. Kelly & W. Harbison, The American  Constitution: Its Origins and Development 110, 118 (7th ed.1991). This is surely powerful  evidence that the right was regarded as fundamental in the sense relevant here.  This understanding persisted in the years immediately following the ratification of the Bill of  Rights. In addition to the four States that had adopted Second Amendment analogues before  ratification, nine more States adopted state constitutional provisions protecting an individual  right to keep and bear arms between 1789 and 1820. Heller, supra, at ___, 128 S.Ct., at 2802- 2804. Founding-era legal commentators confirmed the importance of the right to early  Americans. St. George Tucker, for example, described the right to keep and bear arms as \"the'},\n",

Halderman, 465 U. S. 89, 98-99 (1984); Ex parte New York, supra, at  497. The Eleventh Amendment confirmed, rather than established, sovereign  immunity as a constitutional principle; it follows that the scope of the States’  immunity from suit is demarcated not by the text of the Amendment alone but by  fundamental postulates implicit in the constitutional design. As we explained in  Principality of Monaco:  “Manifestly, we cannot rest with a mere literal application of the words of  §2 of Article III, or assume that the letter of the Eleventh Amendment  exhausts the restrictions upon suits against non-consenting States. Behind  the words of the constitutional provisions are postulates which limit and  control. There is the essential postulate that the controversies, as  contemplated, shall be found to be of a justiciable character. There is also  the postulate that States of the Union, still possessing attributes of  sovereignty, shall be immune from suits, without their consent, save where  there has been ‘a surrender of this immunity in the plan of the convention.’  ” 292 U. S., at 322-323 (quoting The Federalist No. 81 (footnote omitted).  Or, as we have more recently reaffirmed:  “Although the text of the Amendment would appear to restrict only the  Article III diversity jurisdiction of the federal courts, ‘we have understood  the Eleventh Amendment to stand not so much for what it says, but for the  presupposition .. . which it confirms.’ Blatchford v. Native Village of  Noatak, 501 U. S. 775, 779 (1991). That presupposition, first observed over  a century ago in Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890), has two parts: first,  that each State is a sovereign entity in our federal system; and second, that ‘  “[i]t is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit  of an individual without its consent,” ’ id., at 13 (emphasis deleted), quoting  The Federalist No. 81, p. 487 ....” Seminole Tribe, supra, at 54.  Accord, Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U.  S. 139, 146 (1993) (“The Amendment is rooted in a recognition that the States,  although a union, maintain certain attributes of sovereignty, including sovereign  immunity”).  II  In this case we must determine whether Congress has the power, under Article I, to  subject nonconsenting States to private suits in their own courts. As the foregoing  discussion makes clear, the fact that the Eleventh Amendment by its terms limits only  “[t]he Judicial power of the United States” does not resolve the question. To rest on  the words of the Amendment alone would be to engage in the type of ahistorical  literalism we have rejected in interpreting the scope of the States’ sovereign immunity  since the discredited decision in Chisholm. Seminole Tribe, 517 U. S., at 68; see also  id., at 69 (quoting Principality of Monaco, supra, at 326, in turn quoting Hans, 134  U. S., at 15) (“[W]e long have recognized that blind reliance upon the text of the  Eleventh Amendment is ‘“to strain the Constitution and the law to a construction  never imagined or dreamed of” ’ ”).  While the constitutional principle of sovereign immunity does pose a bar to federal  jurisdiction over suits against nonconsenting States, see, e. g., Principality of Monaco,'}]"

McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U. S. 742, 811-812 (2010)  (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).

The word “psychopath” according to some means “a sick mind.” Guttmacher & Weihofen,  Psychiatry and the Law 86 (1952):  “In the light of present knowledge, most of the individuals called psychopathic  personalities should probably be considered as suffering from neurotic character  disorders. They are, for the most part, unhappy persons, harassed by tension and  anxiety, who are struggling against unconscious conflicts which were created during  the very early years of childhood. The nature and even the existence of these  conflicts which drive them restlessly on are unknown to them. When the anxiety rises  to a certain pitch, they seek relief through some antisocial act. The frequency with  which this pattern recurs in the individual is dependent in part upon the intensity of  the unconscious conflict, upon the tolerance for anxiety, and upon chance  environmental situations which may heighten or decrease it. One of the chief  diagnostic criteria of this type of neurotically determined delinquency is the  repetitiveness of the pattern. The usual explanation, as for example, that the  recidivistic check-writer has just `got in the habit of writing bad checks’ is  meaningless.” Id., at 88-89.  Many experts think that it is a meaningless designation. “Not yet is there any common  agreement . . . as to classification or . . . etiology.”   “The only conclusion that seems  warrantable is that, at some time or *127 other and by some reputable authority, the term  psychopathic personality has been used to designate every conceivable type of abnormal  character.”  It is much too treacherously vague a term to allow the high penalty of  deportation to turn on it.  When it comes to sex, the problem is complex. Those “who fail to reach sexual maturity  (hetero-sexuality), and who remain at a narcissistic or homosexual stage” are the products “of  heredity, of glandular dysfunction, [or] of environmental circumstances.”    The homosexual is one, who by some freak, is the product of an arrested development:  “All people have originally bisexual tendencies which are more or less developed and  which in the course of time normally deviate either in the direction of male or  female. This may indicate that a trace of homosexuality, no matter how weak it may  be, exists in every human being. It is present in the adolescent stage, where there is a  considerable amount of undifferentiated sexuality.” Abrahamsen, Crime and the  Human Mind 117 (1944).',\n",

See, e.g., Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 341, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d  799 (1963); Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 5-6, 84 S.Ct. 1489, 12 L.Ed.2d 653 (1964); Pointer  v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 403-404, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965); Washington v. Texas,  388 U.S. 14, 18, 87 S.Ct. 1920, 18 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1967); Duncan, 391 U.S., at 147-148, 88  S.Ct. 1444; Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 794, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969).  The decisions during this time abandoned three of the previously noted characteristics of the  earlier period.11 The Court made it clear that the governing standard is not whether any  \"civilized system [can] be imagined that would not accord the particular protection.\" Duncan,  391 U.S., at 149, n. 14, 88 S.Ct. 1444. Instead, the Court inquired whether a particular Bill of  Rights guarantee is fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty and system of justice. Id., at  149, and n. 14, 88 S.Ct. 1444; see also id., at 148, 88 S.Ct. 1444 (referring to those  \"fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political  institutions\" (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted)).  The Court also shed any reluctance to hold that rights guaranteed by the Bill of Rights met the  requirements for protection under the Due Process Clause. The Court eventually incorporated  almost all of the provisions of the Bill of Rights.12 Only *3035 a handful of the Bill of Rights  protections remain unincorporated.13  Finally, the Court abandoned \"the notion that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the States  only a watered-down, subjective version of the individual guarantees of the Bill of Rights,\"  stating that it would be \"incongruous\" to apply different standards \"depending on whether the  claim was asserted in a state or federal court.\" Malloy, 378 U.S., at 10-11, 84 S.Ct. 1489  (internal quotation marks omitted).

See, e.g., Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 341, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d  799 (1963); Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 5-6, 84 S.Ct. 1489, 12 L.Ed.2d 653 (1964); Pointer  v.

The decisions during this time abandoned three of the previously noted characteristics of the  earlier period.11 The Court made it clear that the governing standard is not whether any  \"civilized system [can] be imagined that would not accord the particular protection.\" Duncan,  391 U.S., at 149, n. 14, 88 S.Ct. 1444.

The Court also shed any reluctance to hold that rights guaranteed by the Bill of Rights met the  requirements for protection under the Due Process Clause. The Court eventually incorporated  almost all of the provisions of the Bill of Rights.12 Only *3035 a handful of the Bill of Rights  protections remain unincorporated.13  Finally, the Court abandoned \"the notion that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the States  only a watered-down, subjective version of the individual guarantees of the Bill of Rights,\"  stating that it would be \"incongruous\" to apply different standards \"depending on whether the  claim was asserted in a state or federal court.\" Malloy, 378 U.S., at 10-11, 84 S.Ct. 1489  (internal quotation marks omitted). Instead, the Court decisively held that incorporated Bill of  Rights protections \"are all to be enforced against the States under the Fourteenth Amendment  according to the same standards that protect those personal rights against federal  encroachment.\" Id., at 10, 84 S.Ct. 1489; see also Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 655-656, 81  S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961); Ker v. California, 374 U.S. 23, 33-34, 83 S.Ct. 1623, 10  L.Ed.2d 726 (1963); Aguilar v.

The Court concludes that §  16-6-2 is valid essentially because “the laws of . . . many States . . . still make such conduct  illegal and have done so for a very long time.” Ante, at 190. But the fact that the moral  judgments expressed by statutes like § 16-6-2 may be ” `natural and familiar . . . ought not to  conclude our judgment upon the question whether statutes embodying them conflict with the  Constitution of the United States.’ ”   Like Justice Holmes, I believe that ”[i]t is revolting  to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV.  It is still more revolting if the grounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long since,  and the rule simply persists from blind imitation of the past.” Holmes, The Path of the Law,  10 Harv. L. Rev. 457, 469 (1897). I believe we must analyze respondent Hardwick’s claim in  the light of the values that underlie the constitutional right to privacy. If that right means  anything, it means that, before Georgia can prosecute its citizens for making choices about the  most intimate *200 aspects of their lives, it must do more than assert that the choice they have  made is an ” `abominable crime not fit to be named among Christians.’ ”    I  In its haste , the Court relegates the actual statute being challenged to a footnote and  ignores the procedural posture of the case before it. A fair reading of the statute and of the  complaint clearly reveals that the majority has distorted the question this case presents.  First, the Court’s almost obsessive focus on homosexual activity is particularly hard to justify in  light of the broad language Georgia has used. Unlike the Court, the Georgia Legislature has  not proceeded on the assumption that homosexuals are so different from other citizens that  their lives may be controlled in a way that would not be tolerated if it limited the choices of  those other citizens.  Rather, Georgia has provided that ”[a] person commits the offense of  sodomy when he performs or submits to any sexual act involving the sex organs of one person  and the mouth or anus of another.”   The sex or status of the persons who engage in the  act is irrelevant as a matter of state law. In fact, to the extent I can discern a legislative purpose  for Georgia’s 1968 enactment of § 16-6-2, that purpose seems to have been to broaden the  coverage of the law to reach heterosexual as well as homosexual activity.  I therefore see  no basis for the *201 Court’s decision to treat this case as an “as applied” challenge to § 16-6- 2,   or for Georgia’s attempt, both in its brief and at oral argument, to defend § 16-6-2  solely on the grounds that it prohibits homosexual activity. Michael Hardwick’s standing may  rest in significant part on Georgia’s apparent willingness to enforce against homosexuals a law  it seems not to have any desire to enforce against heterosexuals.  But his claim that § 16-6- 2 involves an unconstitutional intrusion into his privacy and his right of intimate association  does not depend in any way on his sexual orientation.  Second, I disagree with the Court’s refusal to consider whether § 16-6-2 runs afoul of the  Eighth or Ninth Amendments or the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. [  … ]  II  “Our cases long have recognized that the Constitution embodies a promise that a certain  private sphere of individual liberty will be kept largely beyond the reach of government.”    In construing the right to privacy, the Court has proceeded along two somewhat distinct, *204  albeit complementary, lines.

And two States, Maryland and Hawaii, ban assault pistols.  See Haw.Rev.Stat. Ann. § 134-8; Md.Crim. Law Code Ann. § 4-303 (Lexis 2002).  Second, as I stated earlier, state courts in States with constitutions that provide gun rights have  almost uniformly interpreted those rights as providing protection only against unreasonable  regulation of guns. See, e.g., Winkler, Scrutinizing 686 (the \"courts of every state to consider\" a  gun regulation apply the \"`reasonable regulation\\'\" approach); State v. McAdams, 714 P.2d  1236, 1238 (Wyo.1986); Robertson v. City & County of Denver, 874 P.2d 325, 328  (Colo.1994).  When determining reasonableness those courts have normally adopted a highly deferential  attitude towards legislative determinations. See Winkler, Scrutinizing 723 (identifying only six  cases in the 60 years before the article\\'s publication striking down gun control laws: three that  banned \"the transportation of any firearms for any purpose whatsoever,\" a single \"permitting  law,\" and two as-applied challenges in \"unusual circumstances\"). Hence, as evidenced by the  breadth of existing regulations, States and local governments maintain substantial flexibility to  regulate firearms—much as they seemingly have throughout the Nation\\'s history— *3136 even  in those States with an arms right in their constitutions.  Although one scholar implies that state courts are less willing to permit total gun prohibitions,  see Volokh, Implementing the Right to Keep and Bear Arms for Self-Defense: An Analytical  Framework and a Research Agenda, 56 UCLA L.Rev. 1443, 1458 (2009), I am aware of no  instances in the past 50 years in which a state court has struck down as unconstitutional a law  banning a particular class of firearms, see Winkler, Scrutinizing 723.  Indeed, state courts have specifically upheld as constitutional (under their state constitutions)  firearms regulations that have included handgun bans. See Kalodimos v. Village of Morton  Grove, 103 Ill.2d 483, 499, 83 Ill.Dec. 308, 470 N.E.2d 266, 273 (1984) (upholding a handgun  ban because the arms right is merely a right \"to possess some form of weapon suitable for self- defense or recreation\"); Cleveland v. Turner, No. 36126, 1977 WL 201393, *5 (Ohio Ct.App.,  Aug. 4, 1977) (handgun ban \"does not absolutely interfere with the right of the people to bear  arms, but rather proscribes possession of a specifically defined category of handguns\"); State v.  Bolin 378 S.C. 96, 99, 662 S.E.2d 38, 39 (2008) (ban on handgun possession by persons under  21 did not infringe arms right because they can \"posses[s] other types of guns\"). Thus, the  majority\\'s decision to incorporate the private self-defense right recognized in Heller threatens  to alter state regulatory regimes, at least as they pertain to handguns.  Third, the plurality correctly points out that only a few state courts, a \"paucity\" of state courts,  have specifically upheld handgun bans. Ante, at 3047. But which state courts have struck them  down? The absence of supporting information does not help the majority find support. Cf.  United States v. Wells, 519 U.S. 482, 496, 117 S.Ct. 921, 137 L.Ed.2d 107 (1997) (noting that  it is \"treacherous to find in congressional silence alone the adoption of a controlling rule of  law\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Silence does not show or tend to show a consensus  that a private self-defense right (strong enough to strike down a handgun ban) is \"deeply rooted  in this Nation\\'s history and tradition.\"  * * *',\n",

We have in our political system a government of the United States and a government of each  of the several States. Each one of these governments is distinct from the others, and each has  citizens of its own who owe it allegiance, and whose rights, within its jurisdiction, it must  protect. The same person may be at the same time a citizen of the United States and a citizen  of a State, but his rights of citizenship under one of these governments will be different from  those he has under the other. Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 74.  Citizens are the members of the political community to which they belong. They are the  people who compose the community, and who, in their associated capacity, have established  or submitted themselves to the dominion of a government for the promotion of their general  welfare and the protection of their individual as well as their collective rights. In the formation  of a government, the people may confer upon it such powers as they choose. The government,  when so formed, may, and when called upon should, exercise all the powers it has for the  protection of the rights of its citizens and the people within its jurisdiction; but it can exercise  no other. The duty of a government to afford protection is limited always by the power it  possesses for that purpose.  Experience made the fact known to the people of the United States that they required a  national government for national purposes. The separate governments of the separate States,  bound together by the articles of confederation alone, were not sufficient for the promotion of  the general welfare of the people in respect to foreign nations, or for their complete protection  as citizens of the confederated States. For this reason, the people of the United States, \"in  order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for  *550 the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty\" to  themselves and their posterity (Const. Preamble), ordained and established the government of  the United States, and defined its powers by a constitution, which they adopted as its  fundamental law, and made its rule of action.  The government thus established and defined is to some extent a government of the States in  their political capacity. It is also, for certain purposes, a government of the people. Its powers  are limited in number, but not in degree. Within the scope of its powers, as enumerated and  defined, it is supreme and above the States; but beyond, it has no existence. It was erected for  special purposes, and endowed with all the powers necessary for its own preservation and the  accomplishment of the ends its people had in view. It can neither grant nor secure to its  citizens any right or privilege not expressly or by implication placed under its jurisdiction.  The people of the United States resident within any State are subject to two governments: one  State, and the other National; but there need be no conflict between the two. The powers  which one possesses, the other does not. They are established for different purposes, and have  separate jurisdictions. Together they make one whole, and furnish the people of the United  States with a complete government, ample for the protection of all their rights at home and  abroad. True, it may sometimes happen that a person is amenable to both jurisdictions for one  and the same act. Thus, if a marshal of the United States is unlawfully resisted while executing  the process of the courts within a State, and the resistance is accompanied by an assault on the  officer, the sovereignty of the United States is violated by the resistance, and that of the State  by the breach of peace, in the assault.

For example, recently the Federal Government has, with this  Court\\'s blessing, undertaken to tell the States the age at which they can retire their  law enforcement officers, and the regulatory standards, procedures, and even the  agenda which their utilities commissions must consider and follow. See EEOC v.  Wyoming, 460 U.S. 226, 103 S.Ct. 1054, 75 L.Ed.2d 18 (1983); FERC v. Mississippi,  456 U.S. 742, 102 S.Ct. 2126, 72 L.Ed.2d 532 (1982). The political process*588 has  not protected against these encroachments on state activities, even though they  directly impinge on a State\\'s ability to make and enforce its laws. With the  abandonment of National League of Cities, all that stands between the remaining  essentials of state sovereignty and Congress is the latter\\'s underdeveloped capacity for  self-restraint.  The problems of federalism in an integrated national economy are capable of more  responsible resolution than holding that the States as States retain no status apart  from that which Congress chooses to let them retain. The proper resolution, I  suggest, lies in weighing state autonomy as a factor in the balance when interpreting  the means by which Congress can exercise its authority on the States as States. [ …  ]As far as the Constitution is concerned, a State should not be equated with any  private litigant. Cf. Nevada v. Hall, 440 U.S. 410, 428, 99 S.Ct. 1182, 1192, 59  L.Ed.2d 416 (1979) (BLACKMUN, J., dissenting) (criticizing the ability of a state  court to treat a sister State no differently than a private litigant). Instead, the  autonomy of a State is an essential component of federalism. If state autonomy is  ignored in assessing the means by which Congress regulates matters affecting  commerce, then federalism becomes irrelevant simply because the set of activities  remaining beyond the reach of such a commerce power \"may well be negligible.\"  Ante, at 545.  It has been difficult for this Court to craft bright lines defining the scope of the state  autonomy protected by National*589 League of Cities. Such difficulty is to be  expected whenever constitutional concerns as important as federalism and the  effectiveness of the commerce power come into conflict. Regardless of the difficulty,  it is and will remain the duty of this Court to reconcile these concerns in the final  instance. That the Court shuns the task today by appealing to the \"essence of  federalism\" can provide scant comfort to those who believe our federal system  requires something more than a unitary, centralized government. I would not shirk  the duty acknowledged by National League of Cities and its progeny, and I share  Justice REHNQUIST\\'s belief that this Court will in time again assume its  constitutional responsibility.  I respectfully dissent.           Translating Federalism, v3     These three cases demonstrate yet another effort at crafting limits on  federal power. Rehnquist had predicted in Garcia that the federalists  would be back; here they are, back in Lopez. Morrison further tunes  this newly crafted limit on federal power. But Raich seems to mark yet  another retreat — as evinced both by the author (Stevens) and the  dissent by O\\'Connor. -LL           2.6',\n",

The power a  man has in the state of nature \"of doing whatsoever he thought fit for the preservation of  himself and the rest of mankind, he gives up,\" to a significant extent, \"to be regulated by laws  made by the society.\" J. Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Government § 129, p. 64 (J. Gough  ed.1947).  Limiting the federal constitutional right to keep and bear arms to the home complicates the  analysis but does not dislodge this conclusion. Even though the Court has long afforded special  solicitude for the privacy of the home, we have never understood that principle to \"infring[e]  upon\" the authority of the States to proscribe certain inherently dangerous items, for \"[i]n such  cases, compelling reasons may exist for overriding the right of the individual to possess those  materials.\" Stanley, 394 U.S., at 568, n. 11, 89 S.Ct. 1243. *3109 And, of course, guns that  start out in the home may not stay in the home. Even if the government has a weaker basis for  restricting domestic possession of firearms as compared to public carriage—and even if a  blanket, statewide prohibition on domestic possession might therefore be unconstitutional—the  line between the two is a porous one. A state or local legislature may determine that a  prophylactic ban on an especially portable weapon is necessary to police that line.  Second, the right to possess a firearm of one\\'s choosing is different in kind from the liberty  interests we have recognized under the Due Process Clause. Despite the plethora of  substantive due process cases that have been decided in the post-Lochner century, I have  found none that holds, states, or even suggests that the term \"liberty\" encompasses either the  common-law right of self-defense or a right to keep and bear arms. I do not doubt for a  moment that many Americans feel deeply passionate about firearms, and see them as critical  to their way of life as well as to their security. Nevertheless, it does not appear to be the case  that the ability to own a handgun, or any particular type of firearm, is critical to leading a life of  autonomy, dignity, or political equality: The marketplace offers many tools for self-defense,  even if they are imperfect substitutes, and neither petitioners nor their amici make such a  contention. Petitioners\\' claim is not the kind of substantive interest, accordingly, on which a  uniform, judicially enforced national standard is presumptively appropriate.36  Indeed, in some respects the substantive right at issue may be better viewed as a property right.  Petitioners wish to acquire certain types of firearms, or to keep certain firearms they have  previously acquired. Interests in the possession of chattels have traditionally been viewed as  property interests subject to definition and regulation by the States. Cf. Stop the Beach  Renourishment, Inc. v.

A  defendant\\'s invocation of his right to remain silent, to confront a witness, or to exclude certain  evidence cannot directly cause any threat. The defendant\\'s liberty interest is constrained by  (and is itself a constraint on) the adjudicatory process. The link between handgun ownership  and public safety is much tighter.

Fidelity to meaning is the fidelity that we all expect of any court or judge: it is the effort to preserve the meaning, across context. Fidelity to role is the constraint on that practice of preservation. In this part, I introduce these separate elements. Section 1 begins with a puzzle: Is Article V the exclusive mode by which the Constitution can be amended?And if it is, then was Article XIII of the Articles of Confederation?And if it was, then was the Constitution constitutionally ratified?And if it was, then how do we account for the background context that makes that ratification valid? Section 2 displays both fidelity to role and fidelity to meaning. The first two cases are perfect examples of role; the third sets up the problem for meaning.\",\n",

      "\n",
      "**Case Summary:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Humphrey's Executor v. United States was a landmark case decided by the Supreme Court in 1942 that established the doctrine of judicial review of executive actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Facts:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The United States government had seized control of the rubber industry during World War II under the Emergency Powers Act.\n",
      "* The government imposed price controls on rubber products.\n",
      "* Humphrey's Executor, a rubber manufacturer, challenged the price controls as unconstitutional.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Issue:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The key issue in the case was whether the government's power to regulate prices under the Emergency Powers Act exceeded its constitutional authority.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Holding:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The Supreme Court held that the government's price controls were unconstitutional. The Court found that the Emergency Powers Act violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, which guarantees certain rights against government infringement. Specifically, the Court held that the price controls violated the Fourteenth Amendment's protection of due process because they were arbitrary and capricious.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Reasoning:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The Court's reasoning for its decision was based on the following principles:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Judicial review:** The Court held that the Constitution empowers it to review and declare unconstitutional any act of the executive branch.\n",
      "* **Due process:** The Court emphasized the importance of due process in ensuring that the government does not act arbitrarily and without reason.\n",
      "* **Economic freedom:** The Court recognized the importance of economic freedom and held that price controls stifled competition and innovation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Impact:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Humphrey's Executor was a major turning point in American history. It established the doctrine of judicial review of executive actions, which has been a cornerstone of American jurisprudence ever since. The case has been cited countless times in other cases, and it has had a profound impact on the relationship between the executive and judicial branches.\n",

      "\n",
      "* Humphrey's Executor v. United States established the doctrine of judicial review of executive actions.\n",
      "* The Court held that the government's price controls were unconstitutional because they violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.\n",

    "Query: What are the powers of the U.S. Supreme Court?\n",
    "Answer: The U.S. Supreme Court has several powers, including the authority to interpret the Constitution, oversee cases involving laws of Congress, and resolve disputes between states. Its most critical function is judicial review, the ability to invalidate state and federal laws that conflict with the Constitution. This power was established in the landmark case of Marbury v. Madison. The Court also has appellate jurisdiction over lower court decisions that involve constitutional issues, ensuring uniform interpretation of the law across the country.\n",
    "\\nExample 2:\n",
    "Query: What is the significance of the First Amendment?\n",
    "Answer: The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is significant because it protects several fundamental rights including freedom of speech, press, religion, assembly, and petition. This amendment is a cornerstone of American democratic values, allowing individuals to express themselves without government interference or regulation. The freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment are critical for a free and open society, facilitating active civic engagement and protection of individual liberties.\n",
    "\\nExample 3:\n",
    "Query: How does the separation of powers work in the United States?\n",
    "Answer: The separation of powers in the United States divides government responsibilities into three distinct branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. This structure ensures no single branch becomes too powerful. The legislative branch (Congress) makes laws, the executive branch (headed by the President) implements laws, and the judicial branch (led by the Supreme Court) interprets laws. Checks and balances between these branches prevent abuse of power and ensure the government operates within the framework of the Constitution.\n",

      "- Third, the Constitution requires us to judge the connection between a regulated activity and interstate commerce, not directly, but at one remove. Courts must give Congress a degree of leeway in determining the existence of a significant factual connection between the regulated activity and interstate commerce—both because the Constitution delegates the commerce power directly to Congress and because the *617 determination requires an empirical judgment of a kind that a legislature is more likely than a court to make with accuracy. The traditional words \"rational basis\" capture this leeway.  II Applying these principles to the case at hand, we must ask whether Congress could have had a rational basis for finding a significant (or substantial) connection between gun-related school violence and interstate commerce. Numerous reports and studies—generated both inside and outside government—make clear that Congress could reasonably have found the empirical connection that its law, implicitly or\n",
      "- 737 the consequences of its attack on VMI for public support of private single-sex education. It contends that private colleges that are the direct or indirect beneficiaries of government funding are not thereby necessarily converted into state actors to which the Equal Protection Clause is then applicable. See Brief for United States in No.94-2107, at 35-37 (discussing Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, 457 U. S. 830 (1982), and Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U. S. 991 (1982)). That is true. It is also virtually meaningless. The issue will be not whether government assistance turns private colleges into state actors, but whether the government itself would be violating the Constitution by providing state support to single-sex colleges. For example, in Norwood v. Harrison, 413 U. S. 455 (1973), we saw no room to distinguish between state operation of racially segregated schools and state support of privately run segregated schools. \"Racial discrimination in state-operated schools is barred by the Constitution and `[i]t is also axiomatic that a state may not induce, encourage or promote private persons to accomplish what it is constitutionally forbidden to accomplish.' \"Id., at 465 (quoting Lee v.

      "- 2: Fidelity on the Right 230 Congress may use a relatively trivial impact on commerce as an excuse for broad general regulation of state or private activities,\" id., at 197, n. 27. Rather, \"[t]he Court has said only that where a general regulatory statute bears a substantial relation to commerce, the de minimis character of individual instances arising under that statute is of no consequence.\"Ibid. (first emphasis added). Consistent with this structure, we have identified three broad categories of activity that Congress may regulate under its commerce power. Perez, supra, at 150; see also Hodel, supra, at 276-277. First, Congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce. See, e. g., Darby, 312 U. S., at 114; Heart of Atlanta Motel, supra, at 256 (\"`[T]he authority of Congress to keep the channels of interstate commerce free from immoral and injurious uses has been frequently sustained, and is no longer open to question' \" (quoting Caminetti v. United States,242 U. S. 470, 491 (1917))). Second, Congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities. See, e. g., Shreveport Rate Cases, 234 U. S. 342 (1914); Southern R. Co. v. United States, 222 U. S. 20 (1911) (upholding amendments to Safety Appliance Act as applied to vehicles used in intrastate commerce); Perez, supra,at 150 (\"[F]or example, the destruction of an aircraft (18 U. S. C. § 32), or . . .\n",
      "- But that could be achieved just as well by having them draft their opinions in longhand.4 II If Justice STEVENS' account of the constraints of his approach did not demonstrate that they do not exist, his application of that approach to the case before us leaves no doubt. He offers several reasons for concluding that the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms is not fundamental enough to be applied against the States.5 None is persuasive, but more pertinent to my purpose, each is either intrinsically indeterminate, would preclude incorporation of rights we have already held incorporated, or both. His approach therefore does nothing to stop a judge from arriving at any conclusion he sets out to reach. Justice STEVENS begins with the odd assertion that \"firearms have a fundamentally ambivalent relationship to liberty,\" since sometimes they are used to cause (or sometimes accidentally produce) injury to others.

      "<bos>Marbury v. Madison played a pivotal role in establishing judicial review in the United States Constitution. In this landmark case, the Court established the doctrine of judicial review, empowering it to declare laws unconstitutional. This power is crucial for ensuring that the government operates within the framework of the Constitution and prevents abuse of power.<eos>\n"

    "GPT 4 answer for the same question - Marbury v. Madison was a landmark Supreme Court case that established the principle of judicial review, allowing the Supreme Court to invalidate laws that it determines are in conflict with the Constitution. This case highlighted the court's role in upholding the Constitution as the supreme law of the land, thus reinforcing the judiciary's ability to check the other branches of government."
